# IAM Identity Lifecycle Automation Lab

## Overview
This project simulates an enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM) system focused on identity lifecycle automation and access governance in a higher education environment.

It mirrors real-world IAM operations used by organizations like Tufts Technology Services, including joiner/mover/leaver workflows, role-based access control, and access reviews.

All actions are intentionally simulated to demonstrate IAM logic without requiring access to production systems.

## Improvements for Future Iterations
- API-based integration with Microsoft Graph
- Persistent audit logging
- Approval workflows for access changes
- Role mining and entitlement review automation

## Security Considerations
- Least privilege enforced via RBAC
- Timely deprovisioning of terminated users
- Identification of high-risk access through governance reporting
